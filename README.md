1. Sensory or Cause::`Murder’d` This could represent the motivating factor or the initial impetus for action. In [Hamlet](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1524/1524-h/1524-h.htm), the cause is Hamlet's desire for revenge and justice for his father's death. For you, in a research or interdisciplinary project context, this might translate to the initial research question or problem that sparks your interest.
2. Cognitive or Will::`Revenge` This is about the decision to act. In Hamlet, this is Hamlet's internal struggle with whether to avenge his father’s death. For your work, this could be the point where you decide to commit to a certain research path or project, influenced by your understanding of ICCs (Inter-Class Correlations) and their implications in various fields.
3. Motor or Srength::`Words` This refers to the capacity or resources needed to pursue the chosen path. In the play, Hamlet grapples with his own capabilities and mental state. In your context, this could relate to gathering resources, whether it's funding through NIH grants, NSF, NEH, or forming cross-departmental collaborations to strengthen your research or project.
4. Decision or Be::`Playwright` This is about existence and identity, central themes in Hamlet ("To be, or not to be"). For you, this might involve aligning your work with your personal and professional identity, reflecting on how your work in ICCs, hierarchical models, and tech startups align with your long-term goals and the philosophical underpinnings of your work.
5. Action or Means::`Confession` This is about the methods or approaches used to achieve the goal. In Hamlet, this relates to the various plots and plans he concocts. In a research or project setting, this could involve choosing the right methodologies, technologies (like Jupyter-books, GitHub), and analytical frameworks (such as random effects models) to advance your work.
6. Results or Do::`Blood` Finally, this is the action phase. For Hamlet, it's the culmination of his plans. For you, it's the execution of your research or projects, applying your interdisciplinary knowledge and resources to achieve your objectives, whether it's in understanding ICCs in different disciplines or launching a tech startup.
